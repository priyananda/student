  This file describes the Roller Coaster simulator from an "end-user"
perspective. For details regarding the code and implementation, please

	directory to 'bin' if you are debugging.

	The simulator has two basic modes: RUN and EDIT. In EDIT mode you can
	change the track. In RUN mode you sit back and watch the coaster fly!
	In RUN mode, you have two camera modes, GOD and TRAIN. In GOD mode you
	can move forward/backward, turn horizontally and vertically. In TRAIN
