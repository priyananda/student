Quantum Coaster<br />
CS 559 Fall 2007 - Project 2<br />
priyananda shenoy ( shenoy@cs.wisc.edu )<br />
</b>
<br />
This file describes the RollerCoaster project from the point of view of code and 
implementation. For details regarding the user-interactions, 
refer to <a href="readme.html" >readme</a>.

<p>
<b>Code Organization</b><br/>
  With a few exceptions, I have followed the one-file-one-class
rule: Each class is coded in one .h and one .cpp file, with the
file name same as the class name. Most of the classes have comments
describing them. The comments in the .h file usually tell <I>what</I>
the class/function does, and the comments in the .cpp file tell
<I>how</I> it is done.
<br />
 The <b>base</b> folder contains things I expect to use in project 3 as well.
 Project 2 specific things are present in <b>coaster</b> folder.
<br />
 The <b>resources</b> folder contains the win32 resource file.

<p>
<b>Used Code ("honest plagiarism")</b><br />
  The following specific pieces of code were not written by me:
<ul>
	<li> libtarga.h/libtarga.c - complete - unmodified
  from: Sample Solution for Project1 by Prof Gleicher
	<li> TargaImage.h/.cpp - complete - unmodified
  from: Sample Solution for Project1 by Prof Gleicher
  <li> Command.cpp - function parse - modified
  from: Sample Solution for Project1 by Prof Gleicher
  <li> God.cpp - function turn - modified heavily
  from: DigiBen's Tutorials www.GameTutorials.com
  <li> Win32Helper.cpp - setFont - modified slightly
  from: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms970775.aspx
  <li> Window.cpp - complete - modified heavily. 
  from: my old project http://pixelx.sourceforge.net which in turn
  is based on DigiBen's Tutorials www.GameTutorials.com
  <li> Renderer.cpp - shadowMatrix - modified slightly
  from: http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/glut_examples/advanced/projshadow.c
</ul>

I used ideas and techniques(not code) from these places:
<ul>
	<li>Picking -  http://jerome.jouvie.free.fr/OpenGl/Tutorials/Tutorial27.php
	<li>General ideas - http://graphics.ucsd.edu/courses/cse167_w06/slides/CSE167_15.ppt
	<li>Parallel Transport of frames -  http://www.cs.indiana.edu/pub/techreports/TR425.pdf
</ul>

I took images and textures from various sources. They are:
<ul>
	<li> skybox textures: Alan Baylis, Tutorial 19, Skybox and lens flare
	<li> grass,wall: http://cubeengine.com/
</ul>

<p>
<b>Technical features</b><br />
<ul>
	<li> Cubic B-Spline C<sup>2</sup> continuous curves for tracks.
	<li> Editing of curves - adding, deleting moving control points
	<li> train with multiple bogeys which goes around the track
	<li> scenery in the form of buildings,trees,flags and banner
	<li> Hack shadows - very basic, doesn't use stencil buffer
	<li> vertical sections and loops in tracks
	<li> freeform camera mode for "natural" movement around the world
	<li> Arc-Length parameterization for track rendering and train motion
	<li> Reasonably nice-looking tracks with parallel tracks and ties.
	<li> Tracks can be loaded and saved from and to files
</ul>

<b>Why does the project use Win32? Why not FLTK/GLUT?</b><br />
	I'm not a masochist, I don't <i>like</i> programming in Win32. FLTK/Glut are much easier
to program against. But by the virtue of being simpler, they are also less powerful. I have
a few specific features in mind which I want to implement which I know can be done in Win32.
<br/>
	The real reason I'm not using FLTK/Glut is because I'm lazy. Maybe the features I want can
	be implemented using FLTK/Glut but I'm too lazy to explore. I already know Win32, so there
	is nothing much to learn there. I'm better  off exploring things on the graphics side, than
	in exploring windowing systems.
<br/>
	It isn't really a big deal. All windowing systems are wrappers over Win32 anyway, so all i'm
	doing is creating my own minimalistic wrapper on top of it.
