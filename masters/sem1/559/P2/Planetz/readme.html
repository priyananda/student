Planetz<br/>
CS 559 Fall 2007 - Project 2 Programming checkpoint<br />

<br />
  This file describes the Planetz simulator from an "end-user"
perspective. For details regarding the code and implementation, please
refer to <a href="technical.html">technical.html</a>

<p>
	<b>Running the project</b><br />
	Build and run the project. Initially you will only see the sun. You can
	interact with the tool using the following commands:
	<ul>
		<li><b>A</b> - adds a new planet
		<li><b>D</b> - deletes a planet
		<li><b>SPACE</b> - toggles animation
		<li><b>TAB</b> - switches between planets. selected planet is shown in dark blue.
		<li><b>UP/DOWN</b> - moves selected planet further/closer to the Sun.
		<li><b>T</b> - toggles trails.
 	</ul>

<p>
	<b>What does the project do?</b><br/>
	The project demonstrates a simple hierarchy. The planets revolve around the sun and the 
	moons around the planet. The speed and distance between objects is randomly chosen.

<p>
	<b>This program allows more than 8 planets. Isn't that wrong?</b><br/>
	Yes, it is a bug and will be fixed soon.

<p>
	<b>This is boring. Show me something interesting.</b><br/>
	When the rotation speed of the planet and the moon are aligned, the path tracted out by the moon 
	is a shape called the cardiod. This can be seen by enabling trails.
