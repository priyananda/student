Quantum Coaster<br />
CS 559 Fall 2007 - Project 2<br />

<br />
This file describes the RollerCoaster project from the point of view of code and 
implementation. For details regarding the user-interactions, 
refer to <a href="readme.html" >readme</a>.

<p>
<b>Code Organization</b><br/>
  With a few exceptions, I have followed the one-file-one-class
rule: Each class is coded in one .h and one .cpp file, with the
file name same as the class name. Most of the classes have comments
describing them. The comments in the .h file usually tell <I>what</I>
the class/function does, and the comments in the .cpp file tell
<I>how</I> it is done.
<br />
The cpp/h files are separated into the following logical folders:<br />
<ul>
  <li> command\ - classes which handle generic command processing
  <li>command\impl - classes for specific commands
  <li>tgalib\ - Targa-related code not written by me
  <li>state\ - environment during the execution
  <li>operations\ - code which does image operations like filters
 </ul>

<p>
<b>Used Code ("honest plagiarism")</b><br />
  The following specific pieces of code were not written by me:
<ul>
	<li> libtarga.h/libtarga.c - complete - unmodified
  from: Sample Solution for Project1 by Prof Gleicher
	<li> TargaImage.h/.cpp - complete - unmodified
  from: Sample Solution for Project1 by Prof Gleicher
</ul>
  I took ideas( not code or implementation ) from these sources:
<ul>
	<li>http://www.poynton.com/notes/colour_and_gamma/ColorFAQ.html - Luminance calculation
</ul>

<b>Why does the project use Win32? Why not FLTK/GLUT?</b><br />
	I'm not a masochist, I don't <i>like</i> programming in Win32. FLTK/Glut are much easier
to program against. But by the virtue of being simpler, they are also less powerful. I have
a few specific features in mind which I want to implement which I know can be done in Win32.
<br/>
	The real reason I'm not using FLTK/Glut is because I'm lazy. Maybe the features I want can
	be implemented using FLTK/Glut but I'm too lazy to explore. I already know Win32, so there
	is nothing much to learn there. I'm better  off exploring things on the graphics side, than
	in exploring windowing systems.
<br/>
	It isn't really a big deal. All windowing systems are wrappers over Win32 anyway, so all i'm
	doing is creating my own minimalistic wrapper on top of it.
