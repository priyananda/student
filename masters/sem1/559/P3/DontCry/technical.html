Dont Cry<br />
CS 559 Fall 2007 - Project 3<br />

This file describes the graphics town project from the point of view of code and 
implementation. For details regarding the user-interactions, 
refer to <a href="readme.html" >readme</a>.

<p>
<b>How is the code organized</b><br/>
  With a few exceptions, I have followed the one-file-one-class
rule: Each class is coded in one .h and one .cpp file, with the
file name same as the class name. Most of the classes have comments
describing them. The comments in the .h file usually tell <I>what</I>
the class/function does, and the comments in the .cpp file tell
<I>how</I> it is done.
<br />
 The <b>resources</b> folder contains the win32 resource file.

<b>Detailed Explanation for each feature</b><br />
<b>Terrain</b> The terrain is rendered using a height map. The height map is just an image
where pixel values denote the y dimension of the terrain. From this a mesh of triangles is
created. The terrain is rendered using multitexturing: one "base texture" for the gross
features and a detail texture for finer details.

<br />
<b>Skydome</b> The skydome is like a skybox but is hemispherical in shape. It is rendered
centered on the viewer's position, so it never "moves" relative to the viewer. The skydome
also uses multitexturing: one base texture for clouds(which move across the sky) and a sun
texture to render the sun. The position of the sun is determined by the time of the day.
An attempt to model sunrise and sunset was made, but it didn't come out too realistic.
Shaders are used, but nothing complicated happens( just some conditional multitexturing).

<br />
<b>Sea</b> The sea is just rendered as a flat polygon. It uses multitexturing to convey
waves: one stationary texture to denote the underlying static sea and a moving texture
to denote waves disturbances.

<br />
<b>Volcano</b> The volcano is mostly a painted picture. It also uses Volumetric fog, but
the effect didn't come out as I wanted.

<br />
<b>Gyroscope</b> A gyroscope is a physical entity which maintains its alignment even under
motion. Look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope">wikipedia entry</a> 
for more details. The gyroscope in the project shows how a gyroscope would move, it doesn't
actually simulate a gyroscope. Rendered as lines.

<br />
<b>Bump Mapping</b> A bumpmap is something which changes the way light reflects off a
surface. The simplest way to do this is using a normal map, which is a texture which
represents the normal at every points. Then the lighting value can be deduced using the
dot product of the light vector and the (perturbed) normal. This is called <b>DOT3</b>
bumpmapping. This is done using shaders per pixel.

<br />
<b>Matrix Effect</b> This useless but cool feature tries to emulate the very famous
scene where Trinity fights off the bad guys in The Matrix. In the scene, she jumps in
the air and freezes, the camera then revolves around her and then the action continues.
I couldn't find a loadable Trinity model, so Lara Croft had to do.

<br />
<b>Shaders</b> I used OpenGL Shading Language(GLSL, pronounced GLS-lang) for writing
shaders. Shaders are little programs which run on the GPU. You can write a shader for
every vertex(vertex shader) or every pixel(pixel shader). GLSL is a high level language,
somewhat akin to C, but with primitives more suited for graphical calculations.I learnt
just enough GLSL to get by, so don't know much about it.

<br />
<b>Sweep Object</b> I read in the control points of a bspline from a file and get a
2D curve. Then I generate the solid by rotating this curve around its center.

<br />
<b>Level of Detail</b> For the sweep object, I build multiple triangle meshes which
use the same vertex set but at different resolutions.(in practice I have 3 resolutions:
high,medium and low). Depending on distance from the user, the appropriate mesh is
drawn.

<p>
<b>System requirements</b><br />
OpenGL 2.0 with the following extensione enabled: GL_ARB_multitexture,GL_ARB_vertex_program,
GL_ARB_fragment_program,GL_EXT_fog_coord. Unlikely to perform well on a card below Geforce
6XXX or ATI X700.

<p>
<b>Why does the project use Win32? Why not FLTK/GLUT?</b><br />
	I'm not a masochist, I don't <i>like</i> programming in Win32. FLTK/Glut are much easier
to program against. But by the virtue of being simpler, they are also less powerful. I have
a few specific features in mind which I want to implement which I know can be done in Win32.
<br/>
	The real reason I'm not using FLTK/Glut is because I'm lazy. Maybe the features I want can
	be implemented using FLTK/Glut but I'm too lazy to explore. I already know Win32, so there
	is nothing much to learn there. I'm better  off exploring things on the graphics side, than
	in exploring windowing systems.
<br/>
	It isn't really a big deal. All windowing systems are wrappers over Win32 anyway, so all I'm
	doing is creating my own minimalistic wrapper on top of it.
	
<p>
<b>Why does the project not use the Sample Code? Why reinvent the wheel?</b><br />
	Initially my plan was to create a urban environment( a la GTA ), in which case
using the sample code would have made sense. But seeing the projects done in the 
past few years, I saw there wasn't something spectacularly different I could do
in such a setting. On the other hand outdoor terrains are a rage nowadays, so I
decided to do the island thing. In this case, using the sample code wouldn't have
made a lot of sense. And sometimes, reinventing the wheel can be a lot of fun.
