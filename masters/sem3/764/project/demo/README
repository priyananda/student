Steps to run the demo:

1. run "make" to build the executables. The following
executables must be present in the folder after the build takes place:
	calfpreprocess
	calfcreatedb
	calfblkload
	calfexec
	
2. Run
		perl calfpreprocess tpch tpch.sql
	This command parses the sql file and extracts the table definitions
	and queries from it. It should create two files: "tpch.schema" and
	"tpch.query".

3. Run
		./calfoptimize tpch.schema tpch.query > tpch.opt.schema
	This command uses the analytical cost model to find the optimal
	partitioning. The new schema is written to standard output
	which is captured in the "tpch.opt.schema" file.

4. Run
		./calfcreatedb tpch tpch.opt.schema
	This command creates the database files, one for each supported type.
	After this tool is run, there should be "tpch_row.database",
	"tpch_col.database" and "tpch_grp.database" files created.

5. Run
		./calfblkload tpch_row.database 10000
		./calfblkload tpch_col.database 10000
		./calfblkload tpch_grp.database 10000
	This preloads the database with dummy rows. The second parameter
	is the number of rows. After this you should see 
	"<table>.Slotted.data", "<table>.Column.data", "<table>.Group.data"
	for each table.

6. Run
		./calfexec tpch_row tpch.query
		./calfexec tpch_col tpch.query
		./calfexec tpch_grp tpch.query
	This eecutes each query in the query file and reports the time it took.
	This step must be done on the flash device.
