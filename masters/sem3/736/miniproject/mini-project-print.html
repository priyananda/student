<h2> Mini Project: The Art of Computer Science Measurement: File Systems</h2>

<b>Due Date: Thursday, September 25th, at 5 pm </b>

<br>
<hr noshade>

<h3> Overview</h3>

In this assignment, you will get your feet just a little bit wet with
a computer system. One of the most important parts of computer systems
is <b>evaluation. </b>

Hence, understanding what it takes to perform such an evaluation is a
skill we wish to develop. <br>
<p>

<b>What you're going to do: </b>

First, you have to pick a platform to study. Any Unix-based system
(such as a PC running some version of Linux) is acceptable. For this
assignment, please no Windows-based systems, unless you also do some
Unix-based system in addition. Second, you're going to run some simple
experiments, which you design to bring out various properties of the
file system under test. Third, you are going to create some graphs to
demonstrate those properties -- call them "empirical proofs". Finally,
you will write up what you did. <br>
<p>

<b>You are to work alone on this project. </b>

Talking to your friends at some level is OK, but this should primarily
be an exercise for you. Part of the process is to develop some
measurement skills now for later use in your final project, so do a
good job here and it will pay off down the road. <br>
<h3> More Detail</h3>

In this assignment, we're going to explore the inner-workings of the
file system. In a Unix-based file system, assume we have the following
system calls to work with: <b>open(), close(), read(), write(),
lseek(), </b> and <b>fsync(). </b>

If you don't know what those system calls do, then use the 
<b>man pages </b> to find out. <br>
<p>

Our main approach is going to be to write little code snippets that
exercise the file system in different ways; then, by <b>measuring </b>
how long various operations take, we are going to try to make some
deductions about what the file system is doing. <br>

<h4> Step 0: Platform</h4>

Pick a platform you will work upon. Very likely it will be something
like a PC running Linux, but please feel free to be adventurous -- it
will keep my eyes open when reading your project on a system that is a
bit different, e.g., FreeBSD, some ugly old Unix system like AIX, or
even Mac OS X. However, please do use a Unix-based system. <br>
<p>
Do a little research on the file system. Some systems, such as MacOS
HFS and Linux XFS, use extents in the inode instead of blocks, making
it almost impossible to measure blocksize. The file system layout may
determine some of your experiments.
</p>

<p>
To measure information about the cache, you will need to be able to
control what is in the cache and what is not. There are several ways
of accomplishing this, both with and without root privilege.
</p>

<h4> Step 1: Timers</h4>

The accuracy and granularity of the timer you use will often have a
large affect on your measurements. Therefore, you should use the best
timer available. Fortunately, on x86 platforms, a highly accurate
<b>cycle counter </b> is available. The instruction to use it is known
as <b>rdtsc</b>, (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDTSC">
Wikipedia article </a>) and it returns a 64-bit cycle count. By
knowing the cycle time, one can easily convert the result of rdtsc
into a useful time. On Windows, the <b> QueryPerformanceCounter </b>
API provides access to this feature. Other platforms have similar
highly-accurate timers available - use them! However, there are a few
issues to note:

<ol>

  <li> If the processor can automatically vary the clock speed, the
timestamp counter will not reflect real time. </li>

<li>  On  a  multicore  system,  different processor  cores  may  have
different values for  the timestamp; you can only  compare values on a
single core and not across cores. </li>

</ol>

<br> <p>

Hence, the first thing you should do is: figure out how to use rdtsc
or its analogue (you can use google to find out more about it). Once
you know how to call it and get a cycle count, convert the result to
seconds and measure how long something takes (e.g., a program that
calls sleep(10) and exits should run for about 10 seconds. Confirm
your results make sense by comparing it to a less accurate but
reliable counter such as <b>gettimeofday. </b> <b> Note that
confirmation of timer accuracy is hugely important! </b> If you don't
trust your timer, how can you trust the results of your
measurements? <br>

<h4> Step 2: Measuring the File System</h4>

After getting our timer in order, we will move on and measure some
aspects of the file system proper. All measurements should be done on
the <b>local disk </b> of some machine - do not measure the
performance of a distributed file system such as AFS, where, for
example, your CS account resides. If you aren't using your own
machine, you might consider the
<a href = "http://www.cs.wisc.edu/csl/doc/info/crash/"> Crash and Burn
lab</a> or just one of the other computer labs in the building. <br>
<p>

Through experiments that you design, implement, run, and measure, you
are to answer the following questions: <br>
<blockquote>

<b>What is the ideal buffer size for random file access? </b> Hint:
use reads of varying sizes and plot the time it takes to do such
reads. Also, be wary of prefetching effects that often kick in during
sequential reads. <br>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>During a sequential read of a large file, how much data is
prefetched by the file system? </b> Hint: time each read and plot the
time per read. <br>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>How big is the file cache? </b> Hint: Repeated reads to a group
blocks that fit in cache will be very fast; repeated reads to a group
of blocks that don't fit in cache will be slow. Think about how big
the cache is likely to be compared to the amount of physical memory in
the system. <br>

</blockquote>

<blockquote> <b> For what file sizes does the file system add an
additional layer of indirection? </b> Usually, an inode can only hold
pointers to a few blocks, and after that additional blocks must be
read off disk containing more pointers. Hint: think about using
write() and fsync() to answer this question. Also think about what
happens when you extend a file and suddenly an indirect pointer must
be allocated -- how many more writes occur at that point? <br>

</blockquote>

Hence, in your write-up, <b>you should have one or more graphs which
you use to directly answer the questions above. </b>

Be critical of yourself -- are the conclusions you draw foolproof? Or
are they mere hypotheses? <br>
<p>

A major issue with any data collection is: how convincing are your
numbers? How do you make them more convincing? How do you deal with
experimental noise? etc. Use your common sense and be critical of your
numbers -- do they really convince you that you know the answer? <br>
<p>

One thing you will undoubtedly do is to use <b>repetition </b> to
increase your confidence, i.e., you will take multiple measurements of
an event, and compute (for example) an average over many runs instead
of the result from just a single experiment. Be careful when computing
averages over numbers -- make sure to always first <b>look at all the
data. </b>

If you don't, you might use an average where an average doesn't make
sense. <br>

<h4> Step 3: Writing It Up</h4>

After you're done with experiments, you'll need to write up what
you've done. What should go in your writeup? Here are some tips: <br>
<blockquote>
<b>Title: </b> The title should be descriptive and fit in one line
across the page. <br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Author: </b> Right under the title, this says who you are. <br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Abstract: </b> This is the paper in brief and should state the
basic contents and conclusions of the paper. The abstract is not the
introduction to the paper (it should be shorter), but is a summary of
everything. Read some of the abstracts of papers we've read for class
to get a better idea. In general, the abstract is an advertisement
that should draw the reader into your paper, without being
misleading. It should be complete enough to understand what will be
covered in the paper. This is a technical paper and not a mystery
novel -- don't be afraid of giving away the ending! <br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Intro: </b> A short overview of what you did, and what you
learned. More motivation than the abstract, and more details. Again,
make sure you include your main conclusions. <br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Methodology: </b> How you measured what you measured. Include
something about your timer accuracy here, as well as a description of
the platform you are using to the level of detail such that someone
else could reproduce the experiment elsewhere. <br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Results: </b> This section should consist mainly of <b>graphs, </b>
addressing each of the questions above. Make sure that graphs have
axes labeled (including units). Also make sure to include the <b>code
snippets </b> with each graph (or some rough description of them) so
we have an idea what exactly you measured. Also, make sure to <b>draw
appropriate conclusions </b> about each graph. <br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Conclusions: </b> Summarize your conclusions here, and talk about
what else you have learned in the process. <br>
</blockquote>

This paper should be at most 6 pages long (including everything), in
10 point or larger font, in double column format. In your write-up,
you should not re-describe the assignment. Your paper must be written
using proper English grammar and should have no spelling
mistakes. <br> 

The paper will be graded as follows:<br>
<ul>
<li> <b> Presentation: 1/3 </b> How well written and structured is the
paper? Are the figures and tables legible? </li>
<li> <b> Methodology: 1/3 </b> Is the methodology sound? Will it
accurately measure and return the correct results? Does the reader
have confidence in your results?</li>
<li> <b> Explanation: 1/3 </b> Do you explain your results completely?
Are all features of your results graph explained?</li>
</ul>
<p> 
Here are hints on the writeup:

<ol>
<li>When proposing experiments, describe your hypothesis: how does the
system work, how do you expose that behavior. Make a prediction on
what should happen if your hypothesis is correct. </li>
<li> Don't use passive voice. E.g. the inode is read from disk. Say
the FS reads the inode from disk. </li>
<li> When describing experiments, discuss the relevant details of the
platform, uch as processor type and speed, memory size, OS name and
kernel version. </li>
<li>When graphing, change the scale to highlight the useful stuff. If
nothing happens at the top, chop it off. Log scale may be useful, but
it tends to minimize large percentage differences.</li>
<li> Perform multiple runs to make sure the data is good. Depending on
the test, you might want best case, average case, median case, or
worst case. Understand why. When looking for phenomena, best case may
work well. If using randomness, you may want the median or average
case. </li>
<li> If you have data anomalies, explain why they occur. For example,
if there is a sudden spike or downturn in graph, explain why </li>
<li> Read your paper through completely before handing it in. Spell check
it as well (aspell and ispell are good programs to use with LaTex). </li>
<li> When including code fragments, only include the relevant code. For
example, you can leave out most arithmetic or bookkeeping code that is
not relevant to the computation. </li>
</ol>
</p>


I also recommend/require the following two tools: <br>

<blockquote>
<b></b>

<a href = "http://www.latex-project.org/">  LaTeX</a>

Use this for typesetting your document. <br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b></b>

<a href = "http://www.gnuplot.info/">  gnuplot</a>

Use this for making graphs. <br>
</blockquote>
Check out ~swift/public/latex-example/ for an example of how to use
these tools (run "make pdf" to produce the file main.pdf from
main.tex). LaTeX is an excellent system for writing
academic/scientific papers with, and it is worth spending some amount
of time learning how to use it. Using gnuplot or something like it
(e.g.,
<a href = "http://ploticus.sourceforge.net/doc/welcome.html">
Ploticus</a> ) also makes a lot of sense as these tools produce nice
encapsulated postscript (eps) files to use within LaTeX. epstopdf can
convert these to pdf for generating pdf files from latex directly.<br>

You can
use Microsoft Excel as well, but you need to print the graph as pdf
and then crop it to use in the paper.

<h4> Step 4: Turn it in</h4>
Please email me your paper by midnight on the project due date.<br>

<h4> Step 5: Enjoying Yourself</h4>

Computer systems are complicated, and careful and accurate measurement
is a tricky business. Make sure to have fun! How should you do that?
Probably by
<b>starting early. </b>

As always, feel free to ask me questions if you are having
trouble. Good luck! <br>
