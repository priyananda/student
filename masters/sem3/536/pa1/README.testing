These situations are tested by the 'test' target in the Makefile:
a) No input arguments
	The main program expects the input file name to be passed as
	a commandline parameter. If this is missing, the program should
	print an error message and exit.
b) Nonexistent/inaccessible file
	If the input file is not accessible, then the program should
	print an error message and exit.
c) Duplicates
	If there are multiple repeated symbols in the file, the program
	should print an error message and exit when it detects the second
	occurance of the symbol. The file 'duplicates.txt' has the symbol
	'cat' repeated.
d) Case sensitivity
	The file 'case.txt' has multiple symbols with same letters but
	differing in case. There should be no error messages in this case.
e) Hash collisions
	The file 'hash_collisions.txt' has many symbols that hash to the
	same bucket. There should be no error messages and every symbol
	must be present in the output.

If there are no errors the main program prints the contents of the
symbol table.
