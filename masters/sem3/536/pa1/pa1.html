<h2>Introduction</h2>
</a>

For this assignment you will define two C++ classes:
<samp>Symbol</samp> and <samp>SymbolTable</samp>.
The <samp>Symbol</samp> class will be used to store information about
the identifiers that appear in a program (the variable and function names).
For now, the only information that is to be stored is the name of
the identifier;
more information will be added in future assignments.
The <samp>SymbolTable</samp> class will be used to store a set
of pointers to <samp>Symbol</samp>s, each with a unique name.
<p>
In addition to defining the two classes, you will write a main program
to <a href="#testing">test</a> them.
Ten percent of your grade will be determined by how thoroughly your
<samp>Symbol</samp> and <samp>SymbolTable</samp> classes are tested by
the main program and the test files that you turn in.
<p>
In addition to creating the <samp>Symbol</samp> and <samp>SymbolTable</samp>
classes, this assignment will allow you to gain experience with
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/cs536.html#make"><code>make</code></a>.

<a name="symbol class">
<h2>The Symbol Class</h2>
</a>

For now, the <samp>Symbol</samp> class should have one public data member
<pre>
  <samp>std::string symbolName;</samp>
</pre>
and one public member function (the constructor function)
<pre>
  <samp>Symbol::Symbol(std::string S);</samp>
</pre>
that sets the <samp>symbolName</samp> field to the given value.
Using the name <samp>symbolName</samp> is important for grading purposes.
You will lose points for this assignment if you use a different name!

<a name="string class">
<h3>The string Class</h3>
</a>

To use the <samp>string</samp> class, you must use an appropriate include directive;
any file that needs to access the <samp>string</samp> class
must include the following line at the beginning:
<pre>
<samp>  #include &lt;string&gt</samp>
</pre>
Here are some useful operations on <samp>string</samp>s (not all of which
you'll be using in this assignment):
<pre>
  <samp>S.length()          // the number of characters in string S
  S[k]                // the k-th character in S (starting with 0)
  S1 == S2            // true iff S1 and S2 contain the same sequence of characters
  S1 != S2            // true iff S1 and S2 do <em>not</em> contain the same sequence of characters
  S1 &lt; S2             // true iff S1 comes before S2 in alphabetical order
  cout &lt;&lt; S           // write S to the standard output
  cin &gt&gt S            // reads the next sequence of non-whitespace characters into S

  string str1 = "Hello ";
  string str2 = "there";
  string str3 = str1 + str2; // "Hello there" 

  string str1 = "Hello ";
  string str4 = str1 + "there";  //  "Hello there" 

  string str5 = "The End";
  string str6 = str5 + '!'; //  "The End!"

  S1 = S2             // S1 is assigned the value of S2
  S1 = "hello"        // S1 is assigned the string "hello"
  S1 = 'a'            // S1 is assigned the character 'a'
  S1 += S2            // S2 is attached at the end of S1
  S1 += "hello"       // "hello" is attached at the end of S1
  S1 += 'a'           // 'a' is attached at the end of S1</samp>
</pre>
<p>

<a name="symbol-table class">
<h2>The SymbolTable Class</h2>
</a>

Your <samp>SymbolTable</samp> class should be a hashtable in which
the hash keys are the names of the <samp>Symbol</samp>s.
You may use any reasonable hash function (you can treat a character
like an <samp>int</samp>;
for example: <samp>k + S[0]</samp> is legal).
You must use chaining for collision resolution.
In order to do this, the bucket table of your hashtable should be defined
to be an array of linked lists, where each item in a list element is a
pointer to a <samp>Symbol</samp>.
Rather than writing your own linked-list operations,
you should use the <samp>List</samp> class template defined in:
<pre>
  <samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Supplementary/List/list_T.h">~cs536-1/public/html/Supplementary/List/list_T.h</a></samp>
</pre>
(You will also find this class template useful in later programming
assignments.) 
Using the <samp>List</samp> class template, your <samp>SymbolTable</samp> class
will have a (private) data member declared something like this:
<pre>
<samp>  static const int TABSIZE = 100;
  List&lt;Symbol *&gt; bucketTable[TABSIZE];</samp>
</pre>
<p>
Note that <samp>symboltable.h</samp> should include <samp>list_T.h</samp>.
<p>
You must implement the following (public) operations on
<samp>SymbolTable</samp>s:
<dl>
  <dt> <samp>void SymbolTable::FreeTable()</samp>
    <dd>
    Re-initialize the table to be empty by freeing the storage used by each
    linked list in the array.
    (You can free the storage used by an
    individual list <samp>L</samp> using the function call
    <samp>L.FreeList()</samp>.)
  <dt> <samp>SymbolTable::~SymbolTable()</samp>
    <dd>
    This is the destructor function;
    it should just call <samp>FreeTable</samp>.
  <dt> <samp>void SymbolTable::Insert(Symbol *sym)</samp>
    <dd>
    Insert the given (pointer to a) <samp>Symbol</samp> into the
    <samp>SymbolTable</samp>.
    If there is already a <samp>Symbol</samp> in the table with the
    same name, you should give an error message and quit (you can use
    a call to <samp>assert</samp> to accomplish this --- in that case,
    you must include <samp>&lt;cassert&gt;</samp>).
    Note that case is important, so for example
    <samp>"variableName"</samp> is <em>not</em> the same name as
    <samp>"variablename"</samp> (but you won't have to worry about this
    if you just use the ``<samp>==</samp>'' operator to compare two
    <samp>string</samp>s).
  <dt> <samp>Symbol *SymbolTable::Lookup(string S)</samp>
    <dd>
    If there is a <samp>Symbol</samp> in the table with the given name,
    then return a pointer to that <samp>Symbol</samp>;
    otherwise, return <samp>NULL</samp> (to use <samp>NULL</samp>, you
    should include <samp>&lt;fstream&gt;</samp>).
  <dt> <samp>void SymbolTable::Print(ostream & out)</samp>
    <dd>
    This operation is for debugging.
    It should print the names of all of the <samp>Symbol</samp>s
    currently in the table to the given <samp>ostream</samp>, one per line.
    It should <em>not</em> print anything else!
</dl>
<p>
Note that if you use the declaration of <samp>bucketTable</samp>
given above, you will not need a constructor function (because the
<samp>List</samp> constructor function will be called to initialize
each element of the array to be an empty list).
If you define any pointer data members, you will not only need to
define a constructor function, you will also need to define a
copy-constructor and operator=.
It is easy to get those wrong, so you are strongly advised not to include
any pointer data members!

<a name="what to write">
<h2>What to Write</h2>
</a>

You must implement the <samp>Symbol</samp> and
<samp>SymbolTable</samp> classes using files named
<samp>symbol.h</samp>, <samp>symbol.cc</samp>,
<samp>symboltable.h</samp> and <samp>symboltable.cc</samp>.
(<em>BE SURE TO USE THESE FILE NAMES!</em>)
In addition, you must write a main program, input test files, and
set up the target <samp>test</samp> in your <samp>Makefile</samp>
to <a href="#testing">test</a> your implementation.
<p>
If your main program requires input, it can come from the standard
input (<samp>cin</samp>), or from a file whose name is ``hard coded''
so that the program always reads from the same file (you can name that
file whatever you like, but don't forget to hand it in --- see
``<a href="#turning in">What to Turn In</a>'' below), or the main program
can be written to expect the file as a ``command-line'' argument.
(See the file
<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG1/CodeSkeleton/main.cc">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG1/CodeSkeleton/main.cc</a></samp>
for examples of how to use command-line arguments, how to open a file,
and how to read from that file.)
<p>
You must also write a <samp>Makefile</samp> that is all set up with targets for
both creating and testing your program.
In particular, the <samp>Makefile</samp> must contain the target
<samp>test</samp>, which should perform as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
  Typing <samp>make test</samp> should first create an
  executable named <samp>p1</samp>, and then should run
  <samp>p1</samp> as many times as necessary to test your code.
  (For instance, you may want to have a separate run to test errors like
  a call to the <samp>SymbolTable</samp> <samp>Insert</samp> operation
  with a <samp>Symbol</samp> whose name is already in the table.)
</ul>
(See the file <samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG1/CodeSkeleton/Makefile">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG1/CodeSkeleton/Makefile</a></samp>
for examples of how to define the <samp>p1</samp> and
<samp>test</samp> targets.)

<a name="files">
<h2>Finding/Using the Files for the Assignment</h2>
</a>

We have provided you with a sample program that illustrates the following:
<ul>
  <li> How to use ``command-line'' arguments
  <li> How to open a file (for reading)
  <li> How to read strings from a file
  <li> How to use the List class template
</ul>
When this program is run, it opens the file named on the command line,
then reads names from that file, adding each name to the end of a list.
On end-of-file, it iterates through the list and writes all of the names
to the standard output.
<p>
If the executable is named <samp>a.out</samp> and the input file is named
<samp>data</samp>, then to run the program you type:
<pre>
  <samp>a.out data</samp>
</pre>
<p>
The files for this assignment are in the directory
<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG1/CodeSkeleton">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG1/CodeSkeleton</a></samp>.
You should make a subdirectory called PROG1 in your <em>private</em>
directory, and place in that directory the files that you will be
using and modifying.
To set things up initially, you should issue the following commands:
<pre>
<samp>cd ~/private
mkdir PROG1
cd PROG1
cp ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG1/CodeSkeleton/Makefile .
cp ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG1/CodeSkeleton/main.cc .
cp ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG1/CodeSkeleton/data1 .
ln -s ~cs536-1/public/html/Supplementary/List/list_T.h .
</samp></pre>
<p>
The file <samp>main.cc</samp> can serve as
a starting point for your implementation of the assignment.
<p>
When you initially invoke <samp>make</samp>, you should see something like
the following on your screen:
<pre>
<samp>% make
/s/std/bin/g++ -Wall -g -c main.cc
/s/std/bin/g++ -Wall -g -o p1 main.o</samp>
</pre>
<p>

<a name="testing">
<h2>Testing</h2>
</a>

Part of your task will be to figure out a strategy for testing
your implementation.
As mentioned in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>,
ten percent of your grade will be determined by the testing scheme
that you implement; i.e., how thoroughly
your <samp>Symbol</samp> and <samp>SymbolTable</samp> classes
are tested by your main program and the test files that you turn in.
<p>
You are to add commands that invoke your tests to your <samp>Makefile</samp>.
The <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG1/CodeSkeleton/Makefile"><samp>Makefile</samp>
that we have provided you with</a> serves as an example of how to
do this.
It includes a target, named <samp>test</samp>, that invokes a couple of tests.
<p>
In addition, put a brief description of each test (e.g., what it tests
for and how it goes about doing so) in a file named <samp>README.testing</samp>,
<em>which is to be turned in, along with your source code and test
files</em>.
<p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="turning in">
<h2>What To Turn In</h2>
</a>

To hand in your program, copy all of the files that are needed to
create and run the <samp>p1</samp> executable (including your
Makefile, a copy of <samp>list_T.h</samp>,
your <samp>README.testing</samp> file, and any required test data files) to
<pre>
  <samp>~cs536-1/public/Handin1/&lt;<i>your login name</i>&gt;</samp>
</pre>
using your actual login name in place of &lt;<i>your login name</i>&gt;.
Please do <em>not</em> create any subdirectories in your handin directory,
and be sure <em>not</em> to copy any object files or executable files
(they take up a lot of space and may cause the directory to exceed its
quota).
<p>
After you have copied over your files, you can check that they
are there by issuing the command
<pre>
  <samp>ls -l ~cs536-1/public/Handin1/&lt;<i>your login name</i>&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
REMEMBER: <em>No late assignments will be accepted without prior
permission!</em>
Thus, it is important that you get to work soon.
<p>
As always, remember that partially finished programs are better than
no programs at all, so be sure to turn in whatever you've done -- even
if you don't finish the assignment.
If you do turn in only a partially finished program, it is a good
idea to provide a description (say in a file called <samp>README</samp>)
of what works, what doesn't work, and sketch out how you would have gone
about changing things to finish up.
<p>
<em>GOOD LUCK!!</em>
