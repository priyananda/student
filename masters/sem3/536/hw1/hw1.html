    <ol>
       <li> For each of the following languages over the alphabet {0,1}, give a
            deterministic finite-state machine that accepts the language:
	<ol>
	  <li> The set of all strings ending in 10
	  </li><li> The set of all strings such that the next-to-last symbol is 1.
	  </li><li> The set of strings in which there are at least two 1's and at least one 0.
	</li></ol>
        For each machine, give a trace of its actions for the inputs 1010 and 0101.
       <p>
       </p></li><li> For each of the following languages over the alphabet {0,1}, give a
            nondeterministic finite-state machine that accepts the language:
	<ol>
	  <li> The set of all strings ending in 10
	  </li><li> The set of all strings such that the next-to-last symbol is 1.
	</li></ol>
        Again, for each machine, explain what happens for the inputs
        1010 and 0101.
        <p>
        <b>Note</b>: Your answers must be different from the deterministic machines
        that you give for Question 1, and they must use nondeterminism
        in a significant way.  For instance, you will not receive
        credit if you just stick in a gratuitous epsilon transition.
        (Actually, you should find that the nondeterministic machines are
        simpler than the corresponding deterministic machines.)
       </p><p>
       </p></li><li> Write a regular expression for each of the following languages
            over the alphabet {0,1}:
	<ol>
	  <li> The set of strings whose length is a multiple of 3.
	  </li><li> The set of strings that contain 000 as a substring.
	  </li><li> The set of strings that contain exactly three 0's.
	</li></ol>
        Note: Your grade for this part will depend in part on how easy
        it is for us to understand your answer.
        You will increase your chances of receiving full credit
        if you provide explains of the roles of the main subexpressions
        of your regular expressions.
       <p>
       </p></li><li> Which of the following strings are accepted by
            the regular expression (0*) | (0*10*) | (0*1(00<sup>+</sup>|1)*10*),
            and why?
	<ol>
	  <li> 00100
	  </li><li> 00110
	  </li><li> 01010
	</li></ol>
       <p>
       </p></li><li> For arbitrary regular expressions R and S, prove or disprove
            the following statements: 
	<ol> 
	  <li>  RS = SR
	  </li><li>  ( S | R ) * = R* | S*
	  </li><li>  ( R* S* ) * = ( R | S ) *
        </li></ol>
        For each of these assertions, by "lhs = rhs", we mean "L(lhs) = L(rhs)".
        A statement may be <em>disproved</em> by giving a counterexample.
        To <em>prove</em> a statement, you must argue that it holds for
        two arbitrarily chosen regular expressions R and S.
