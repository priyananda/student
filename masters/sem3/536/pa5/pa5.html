<a name="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
</a>

For this assignment, you will write a code generator that generates
MIPS assembly code for a <samp>Simple</samp> program represented as an
abstract-syntax tree.
You will also create appropriate <samp>Simple</samp> programs
to test your code generator, and you will execute the code
you generate under the control of the <samp><a href="#spim">Spim</a></samp>
simulator of the MIPS instruction set.
</p><p>
Similar to the <samp>Unparse</samp>, <samp>NameAnalysis</samp>, and
<samp>TypeCheck</samp> passes that you wrote for Programming Assignments
3 and 4, the code generator will be implemented as a collection
of member functions for the various kinds of AST nodes.
So that we can know where to look for your code, <b>you must put this
code in a file named <samp>codegen.cc</samp></b>.
</p><p>
You will also update the <samp>main</samp> program you wrote for
Programming Assignment 4 so that, if there are no errors
(including type errors), the code generator is called after the type checker.
</p><p>
You should set up your <samp>Makefile</samp> so that typing
<samp>"make"</samp> creates the executable <samp>simple</samp>.
That executable should take one command-line argument (the name of
the <samp>Simple</samp> program
to be compiled), and it should write MIPS assembly code (suitable
for input to the <samp>Spim</samp> simulator)
to a file named <samp>xxx.spim</samp>, where <samp>xxx</samp>
is the name of the input file.
(For instance, the result of compiling a program in a file named
<samp>test.simple</samp> should go into the file named
<samp>test.simple.spim</samp>.)
</p><p>
As usual, ten percent of your grade will be based on how well you
test your code.
Therefore, you must provide a suite of <samp>Simple</samp> programs that
thoroughly tests your code generator, and you must set up your
<samp>Makefile</samp> so that
<samp>"make test"</samp> creates the executable
<samp>simple</samp> and runs it on your test programs.
(<b>Note: <samp>"make test"</samp> should <em>not</em> run
<samp>spim</samp>, just <samp>simple</samp>.  The TA will
be applying your compiler to our own suite of test programs,
and executing the compiled versions of those programs.
The command <samp>"make test"</samp> is just so we can see how
well a job you have done exercising your code generator.</b>)

<a name="spim">
<h2>Spim</h2>
</a>

For your convenience, here is a link to documentation on <samp>spim</samp>,
the emulator of the MIPS instruction set that will be used in this assignment:
</p><ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Elarus/SPIM/spim_documentation.pdf">SPIM Reference Manual (in PDF)</a>
</li></ul>
You can run ``plain'' spim by typing:
<pre>  <samp>spim -file xxx</samp>
</pre>
where <samp>xxx</samp> is the name of the file produced by your compiler.
Or you can use the X-windows version by doing the following:
<ol>
  <li>
    Issue the command <samp>xspim</samp>.
    This will open a new window.
  </li><li>
    Click on the ``load'' button.
    This will open a small window in which you should type the name of
    the file produced by your compiler;
    finish with a carriage-return, or click on the
    ``assembly file'' button in the small window.
  </li><li>
    Click on the ``run'' button.
    This will open another small window.
    Click on the ``ok'' button in that window.
</li></ol>
Syntax and runtime errors will be reported at the bottom of the large
window opened when you first typed <samp>xspim</samp>.
If your Simple program produces output, yet another window will be opened,
and the output will be written to that window.
<p>
So that you can experiment with <samp>Spim</samp>, here is a sample
source file and the corresponding assembly-code file:
</p><pre>  <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG5/Description/test.assign.global.simple">/p/course/cs536-reps/public/html/Programs/PROG5/Description/test.assign.global.simple</a>
  <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG5/Description/test.assign.global.simple.spim">/p/course/cs536-reps/public/html/Programs/PROG5/Description/test.assign.global.simple.spim</a>
</pre>

<a name="code changes">
<h2>Changes to Your Old Code</h2>
</a>

Required changes:
</p><ol>
  <li>
    Add to the name analyzer (or type checker, as appropriate) a check
    on whether function <samp>main</samp> has one or more parameters.
    If <samp>main</samp> does have parameters, the error message
    <pre>      <samp>Main function has parameters</samp>
    </pre>
    should be issued.  (The line and column position should be reported as 0:0.)
  </li><li>
    Add a new <samp>offset</samp> field to the <samp>Symbol</samp> class.
    Change your symbol-handling code to compute offsets for each function's
    parameters and local variables (i.e., where in the function's activation record
    they will be stored at runtime) and to fill in the new offset field.
    Note: When doing code generation, you will need to know whether each variable
    is local or global;
    one way to distinguish them is to use some special value
    as the offset for all globals (e.g., use 1 for globals, and non-positive
    offsets for locals).
  </li><li>
    Change the definition of all subclasses of class
    <samp>ExpNode</samp> to include a (private) field (e.g.,
    <samp>myType</samp>) to hold the type of the operation that has to
    be performed, and change your type-checking function to fill in
    that field.
    (It is also convenient to do the same thing for
    <samp>WriteStmtNode</samp>, since <samp>write</samp> is also an
    overloaded symbol of the language.)
</li></ol>
<p>
The following changes may be helpful for code generation, but are not required:
</p><ol>
  <li>
    Keep track of the total number of local variables declared in each function
    (e.g., by adding a new <samp>numberOfLocals</samp> field to the <samp>Symbol</samp>
    class, filled in only for functions).
  </li><li>
    Keep track of the total number of parameters declared in each function
    (e.g., by adding a new <samp>numberOfParameters</samp> field to the <samp>Symbol</samp>
    class, filled in only for functions).
  </li><li>
    Change the definition of class <samp>WriteStmtNode</samp> to
    include a (private) field (e.g., <samp>myType</samp>) to hold the
    type of the expression being written, and change your
    type-checking function for the <samp>WriteStmtNode</samp> to fill
    in that field.
</li></ol>

<a name="simple semantics">
<h2>Non-Obvious Semantic Issues</h2>
</a>

</p><ul>
  <li>
    The ``and'' and ``or'' operators (<samp>&amp;&amp;</samp> and <samp>||</samp>)
    are <em>short circuited</em>, just as they are in C++.
    That means that their right operands are only evaluated if
    necessary (for all of the other binary operators, both operands
    are always evaluated).
    If the left operand of <samp>&amp;&amp;</samp> evaluates to <samp>false</samp>,
    then the right operand is not evaluated (and the value of the whole
    expression is <samp>false</samp>);
    similarly, if the left operand of <samp>||</samp>
    evaluates to <samp>true</samp>, then the right operand is not evaluated
    (and the value of the whole expression is <samp>true</samp>).
  </li><li>
    Two strings are considered to be equal only if they are stored
    at the same address (yes, this is ugly, but it will make your
    implementation much easier!).
    Thus, the first two conditions shown below should evaluate to <samp>false</samp>,
    and the third condition should evaluate to <samp>true</samp>:
<ol>
<li>
  <pre>    <samp>x = "a";
    y = "a";
    if (x == y) ...</samp>
  </pre>
</li><li>
  <pre>    <samp>if ( "a" == "a" ) ...</samp>
  </pre>
</li><li>
  <pre>    <samp>x = "a";
    y = x;
    if (x == y) ...</samp>
  </pre>
</li></ol>
  </li><li>
    A <samp>write</samp> statement should output the value of the given expression
    with no extra characters such as spaces, tabs, or newlines.
    To write a newline, use: <samp>write("\n");</samp>
  </li><li>
    Boolean values should be output as <samp>true</samp> and <samp>false</samp>
    (although internally, you will probably want to represent <samp>true</samp>
    as <samp>-1</samp> and <samp>false</samp> as <samp>0</samp>).
</li></ul>
<p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="suggestions">
<h2>Suggestions</h2>
</a>

</p><ul>
  <li>
    Use an <samp>ofstream</samp> (not a <samp>FILE *</samp>) for the output file.
    Make it a global variable (declared in your <samp>main</samp> program) so that
    you do not have to pass it around to all of the code-generating functions.
    Use a variable of type <samp>String</samp> for the name of the output file.
    Set the file name by first assigning from <samp>argv[1]</samp> (the name
    of the input file) and then appending <samp>".spim"</samp> using the <samp>+</samp> operator.
    Use the <samp>open</samp> member function to open the file (that function
    requires the file name as its argument), and use the <samp>fail</samp> member
    function (with no arguments) to test whether the open succeeded.
    For example:
    <pre>      <samp>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
      #include &lt;iostream&gt;
      #include &lt;fstream&gt;
      #include &lt;string&gt;
      . . .

      std::ofstream outFile;

      . . .

      // In function main:

          // OPEN OUTPUT FILE
          String fname = argv[1];
          fname = fname + ".spim";
          outFile.open(fname);
          if (outFile.fail()) {
            cerr &lt;&lt; "Unable to open " &lt;&lt; fname &lt;&lt; endl;
            exit(1);
          }</samp>
    </pre>
  </li><li>
    Implement code generation for global declarations, function entry, and
    function exit first.
    Write a test program that just declares some variables
    and functions, and make sure you can generate and run spim code for that
    test program.
    Next, implement code generation for statements and expressions
    (one kind at a time).
    Start with the <samp>write</samp> statement and test your code generator
    for every new statement and expression by writing out the result
    of the newly implemented operation.
  </li><li>
    Use the values <samp>0</samp> and <samp>-1</samp> to represent false and
    true internally (this will make implementing the not operator (<samp>!</samp>)
    easier, because <samp>Spim</samp> includes a <samp>not</samp> instruction, and that operation
    applied to <samp>0</samp> yields <samp>-1</samp>, while applying it to <samp>-1</samp> yields
    <samp>0</samp>).

<h2>Finding/Using the Files for the Assignment</h2>
</a>

No code skeleton is provided to you for this assignment;
however, code for several utility functions for generating
labels and assembly-code instructions, can be found in the following files:
</p><pre>  <samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG5/CodeSkeleton/generate.h">/p/course/cs536-reps/public/html/Programs/PROG5/CodeSkeleton/generate.h</a>
  <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG5/CodeSkeleton/generate.cc">/p/course/cs536-reps/public/html/Programs/PROG5/CodeSkeleton/generate.cc</a></samp>.
</pre>
<p>
You are encouraged to use the code that you wrote for
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG4/Description/assign4.html">Programming Assignment 4</a>.
However, if you were unable to complete that program, a working
version is supplied in the directory
<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG4/CodeSolution">/p/course/cs536-reps/public/html/Programs/PROG4/CodeSolution</a></samp>.
</p><p>
You should make a subdirectory called <samp>PROG5</samp>
in your <samp>private</samp> directory, and work on things for
this programming assignment in that subdirectory.
To set things up initially, you should issue the following commands:
</p><pre><samp>cd ~/private
mkdir PROG5
cd PROG5
ln -s ~cs536-1/public/html/Supplementary/List/list_T.h .
ln -s ~cs536-1/public/html/Supplementary/ref_ptr/ref_ptr_T.h .
ln -s ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG5/CodeSkeleton/generate.h .
ln -s ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG5/CodeSkeleton/generate.cc .
cp ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG5/Description/test.assign.global.simple .
cp ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG5/Description/test.assign.global.simple.spim .</samp>
</pre>

<a name="testing">
<h2>Testing</h2>
</a>

Part of your task will be to figure out a strategy for testing
your implementation.
As mentioned in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>,
part of your grade will be determined by the testing scheme
that you implement; i.e., how thoroughly the test files that you turn
in test your code generator.
</p><p>
As usual, put a brief description of each of your tests (e.g., what
it tests for and how it goes about doing so) in a file named
README.testing, <em>which is to be turned in, along with your source
code and test files</em>.
</p><p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="turning in">
<h2>What To Turn In</h2>
</a>

To hand in your program, copy all of the files that are needed to
create and run <samp>simple</samp> and <samp>simple.purecov</samp>,
including your Makefile and your test program(s), to
</p><pre>  <samp>~cs536-1/public/Handin5/&lt;<i>your login name</i>&gt;</samp>
</pre>
using your actual login name in place of &lt;<i>your login name</i>&gt;.
Please do <em>not</em> create any subdirectories in your handin directory,
and be sure <em>not</em> to copy any object files or executable files
(they take up a lot of space and may cause the directory to exceed its
quota).
<p>
After you have copied over your files, you can check that they
are there by issuing the command
</p><pre>  <samp>ls -l ~cs536-1/public/Handin5/&lt;<i>your login name</i>&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
REMEMBER: <em>No late assignments will be accepted without prior
permission!</em>
Thus, it is important that you get to work soon.
</p><p>
As always, remember that partially finished programs are better than
no programs at all, so be sure to turn in whatever you've done --- even
if you don't finish the assignment.
If you do turn in only a partially finished program, it is a good
idea to provide a description (say in a file called <samp>README</samp>)
of what works, what doesn't work, and sketch out how you would have gone
about changing things to finish up.
</p><p>
<em>GOOD LUCK!!</em>
