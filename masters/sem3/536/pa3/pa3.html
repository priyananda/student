<H2>Introduction</H2>
</A>

For this assignment you will use the parser-generator <SAMP>bison</SAMP>
to write a parser for the <SAMP>Simple</SAMP> language.
Skeleton versions of the files you will need to write are provided in
the directory
<SAMP><A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/CodeSkeleton">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG3/CodeSkeleton</A></SAMP>.
The (incomplete) <SAMP>bison</SAMP> specification is in the file
<SAMP><A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/CodeSkeleton/simple.y">simple.y</A></SAMP>.
The complete context-free grammar for the <SAMP>Simple</SAMP> language is in
the file <SAMP><A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/CodeSkeleton/simple.grammar">simple.grammar</A></SAMP>.
You will need to extend <SAMP>simple.y</SAMP> by adding grammar productions
and associated actions so that the generated parser
builds an abstract-syntax tree representation of the parsed program.
The classes you will need to use to build the abstract-syntax tree
are defined in the files
<SAMP><A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/CodeSkeleton/ast.h">ast.h</A></SAMP> and
<SAMP><A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/CodeSkeleton/ast.cc">ast.cc</A></SAMP>.
You will also write <SAMP>Unparse</SAMP> operations as member functions of
the various abstract-syntax tree node classes.
The <SAMP>Unparse</SAMP> operation will be used to print (to <SAMP>cout</SAMP>)
a nicely formatted version of the program represented by the tree.
Writing the <SAMP>Unparse</SAMP> operations will involve adding code to the
file <SAMP>unparse.cc</SAMP>.

<P>
As usual, ten percent of your grade will be based on how well you
test your code (your parser and your <SAMP>Unparse</SAMP> operations).
Therefore, you must provide one or more <SAMP>Simple</SAMP> programs that
thoroughly tests your code, and you must set up your <SAMP>Makefile</SAMP>
so that ``<SAMP>make test</SAMP>&#39;&#39;
creates the executable <SAMP>parse</SAMP>
and runs it on your test input.
</P><P>
You are encouraged to use the scanner you wrote for
<A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG2/Description/assign2.html">Programming Assignment 2</A>
(with some modifications, see below).
However, if you were unable to complete a correct scanner, a working
version is supplied in the directory
<SAMP><A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSolution">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSolution</A></SAMP>.
(You will still need to make the modifications described
<A href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/Description/assign3.html#changes">below</A>.)

<A name="changes">
<H2>Changes from Previous Programs</H2>
</A>

</P><H3>Scanner Changes</H3>
For parsing, the type of <SAMP>yylval</SAMP> will include the types of
nonterminal symbols as well as tokens.
Thus, the type of <SAMP>yylval</SAMP> becomes a <SAMP>union</SAMP> type,
one alternative of which is of type <SAMP>TokenType</SAMP>.
(You don&#39;t have to worry about defining <SAMP>yylval</SAMP> directly;
that is done by <SAMP>bison</SAMP> when it processes the
``<SAMP>&percnt;union</SAMP>&#39;&#39; in the definitions part of your specification.)
However, three changes to <SAMP>simple.l</SAMP> are necessary:
<UL>
  <LI>
    In the definition given in the skeleton version of <SAMP>simple.y</SAMP>,
    the <SAMP>TokenType</SAMP> field is named <SAMP>TOKENval</SAMP>.
    To be consistent with this definition, you must replace all instances of
    ``<SAMP>yylval.xxx</SAMP>&#39;&#39; in your scanner actions with
    ``<SAMP>yylval.TOKENval.xxx</SAMP>&#39;&#39;.
  </LI><LI>
    Your <SAMP>simple.l</SAMP> file must also include the file <SAMP>ast.h</SAMP>
    <EM>before</EM> including <SAMP>gram.tab.h</SAMP>.
</LI></UL>

<A name="operator precedences">
<H2>Operator Precedences and Associativities</H2>
</A>

The <SAMP>Simple</SAMP> grammar in the file <SAMP>simple.grammar</SAMP>
is ambiguous;
it does not uniquely define the precedences and associativities of
the arithmetic, relational, equality, and logical operators.
You will need to change the <SAMP>bison</SAMP> specification
to give the various operators the correct precedences and associativities.
You can do this either by rewriting the grammar (just to give the operators
the correct precedences and associativities --- do <EM>not</EM>
make the grammar LL(1)), or by providing appropriate precedence
and associativity declarations.
My recommendation is that you use precedence and associativity declarations.
(See the
<A href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/Description/assign3.html#bison documentation"><SAMP>bison</SAMP> documentation</A>
for information about how to provide appropriate precedence
and associativity declarations.)
<UL>
  <LI> All of the binary operators are left associative, except the relational
       and equality operators (<SAMP>&lt;</SAMP>, <SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>,
       <SAMP>&lt;=</SAMP>, <SAMP>&gt;=</SAMP>, <SAMP>==</SAMP>,
       and <SAMP>!=</SAMP>), which are non-associative (i.e., expressions
       like ``<SAMP>a &lt; b &lt; c</SAMP>&#39;&#39;
       are not allowed and should cause a syntax error).
  </LI><LI> The <EM>unary minus</EM> and <EM>not</EM> (<SAMP>!</SAMP>)
       operators have the highest precedence, then <EM>multiplication</EM>
       and <EM>division</EM>, then <EM>addition</EM> and <EM>subtraction</EM>,
       then the relational and equality operators, and finally,
       the logical operators (<EM>and</EM> (<SAMP>&amp;&amp;</SAMP>) and <EM>or</EM>
       (<SAMP>||</SAMP>)).
</LI></UL>
If you get a message like
<PRE>  <SAMP>simple.y contains 48 shift/reduce conflicts</SAMP>
</PRE>
when you process your <SAMP>bison</SAMP> specification, it means
that your grammar is still ambiguous, and the parser is unlikely
to work correctly.  <B>Do not ignore this message!</B>
Go back and fix your specification.

<A name="syntax errors">
<H2>Reporting Syntax Errors</H2>
</A>

The parser generated by <SAMP>bison</SAMP> will call the function
<SAMP>yyerror</SAMP> when it finds a syntax error;
it will then return the value 1.
You should modify <SAMP>yyerror</SAMP> (in the file <SAMP>parser.cc</SAMP>)
so that it calls your special error-handling function rather than just printing
the error message directly.

<A name="building ast">
<H2>Building an Abstract-Syntax Tree</H2>
</A>

To make your parser build an abstract-syntax tree, you must add new
productions, declarations, and actions to <SAMP>simple.y</SAMP>.
You will need to decide, for each nonterminal that you add, what
type its associated value should have.
Then you must add the appropriate ``<SAMP>&percnt;type</SAMP>&#39;&#39;
declaration to the grammar.
For most nonterminals, the value will either be a pointer to some
subclass of <SAMP>ASTnode</SAMP>, or a pointer to a <SAMP>List</SAMP>
of pointers to some subclass of <SAMP>ASTnode</SAMP>
(use the information in <SAMP>ast.h</SAMP> to guide
your decision).
You must also add actions to each new grammar production to assign the
appropriate value to the left-hand-side nonterminal.

<A name="unparsing">
<H2>Unparsing</H2>
</A>

To test your parser, you must finish writing the <SAMP>Unparse</SAMP>
operations for the subclasses of <SAMP>ASTnode</SAMP>.
When the <SAMP>Unparse</SAMP> operation of the root node of the program&#39;s
abstract-syntax tree is called, it should print a nicely formatted
version of the program (this is called <SAMP>unparsing</SAMP>
the abstract-syntax tree).
The output produced by calling <SAMP>Unparse</SAMP> should be the
same as the input to the parser except that:
</P><OL>
  <LI> There will be no comments in the output.
  </LI><LI> The output will be ``pretty printed&#39;&#39; (newlines and indentation
       will be used to make the program readable); and
  </LI><LI> Expressions will be fully parenthesized to reflect the order of
       evaluation.
</LI></OL>
For example, if the input program includes:
<PRE>  <SAMP>if (b == -1) { x = 4+3*5-y; while (c) { y = y*2+x; } }</SAMP>
</PRE>
the output of <SAMP>Unparse</SAMP> should be something like the following:
<PRE>  <SAMP>if ((b == -1)) {
      x = ((4 + (3 * 5)) - y);
      while (c) {
          y = ((y * 2) + x);
      }
  }</SAMP>
</PRE>
(Put one space around each binary operator, such as
<SAMP>+</SAMP>, <SAMP>=</SAMP>, <SAMP>==</SAMP>, etc., and
use four spaces for indentation.)
<P>
To help you with producing the correct output format, one test
has been provided:
When your parser is supplied the input file
<SAMP><A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/CodeSkeleton/example.simple">example.simple</A></SAMP>
it should produce output that (roughly) matches
<SAMP><A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/CodeSkeleton/example.simple.expected">example.simple.expected</A></SAMP>.
I say ``roughly&#39;&#39;, since the number of blank lines produced by
your version may not be exactly the same.
(<EM>Note: <SAMP>example.simple</SAMP> is not intended as an exhaustive test
of your parser, but simply as an example for you to see that your
<SAMP>Unparse</SAMP> function is producing the desired result.</EM>)
</P><P>
Note: Trying to unparse a tree will help you determine whether you have
built the tree correctly in the first place.
It is a good idea to add a few grammar productions at a time to
<SAMP>simple.y</SAMP>,
and to write the corresponding <SAMP>Unparse</SAMP> operations,
rather than trying to complete <SAMP>simple.y</SAMP> before working on
the <SAMP>Unparse</SAMP> operations.

<H2>Finding/Using the Files for the Assignment</H2>
</A>

The files for this assignment are in the directory
<SAMP><A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/CodeSkeleton">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG3/CodeSkeleton</A></SAMP>.
You should make a subdirectory called <SAMP>PROG3</SAMP>
in your <SAMP>private</SAMP> directory, and place in that directory
the files that you will be using and modifying.
To set things up initially, you should issue the following commands:
</P><PRE><SAMP>cd ~/private
mkdir PROG3
cd PROG3
ln -s ~cs536-1/public/html/Supplementary/List/list_T.h .
ln -s ~cs536-1/public/html/Supplementary/ref_ptr/ref_ptr_T.h .
cp ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG3/CodeSkeleton/example.simple .

</PRE>
<P>
<B>NOTE</B>: At this point, issuing the command
</P><PRE>  <SAMP>make parse</SAMP>
</PRE>
will <B>fail</B>.
You need to provide appropriate versions of <SAMP>scanner.h</SAMP>,
<SAMP>simple.l</SAMP>, <SAMP>message.h</SAMP>, and <SAMP>message.cc</SAMP>
before you can build the parser initially.
<P>
As mentioned earlier, you are encouraged to use the scanner you wrote for
<A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG2/Description/assign2.html">Programming Assignment 2</A>
(with some modifications, see below).
However, if you were unable to complete a correct scanner, a working
version is supplied in the directory
<SAMP><A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSolution">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSolution</A></SAMP>.

<A name="testing">
<H2>Testing</H2>
</A>

Part of your task will be to figure out a strategy for testing
your implementation.
As mentioned in the <A href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/Description/assign3.html#introduction">Introduction</A>,
part of your grade will be determined by the testing scheme
that you implement; i.e., how thoroughly your main program and the test
files that you turn in test your parser.
</P><P>
As usual, put a brief description of each of your tests (e.g., what
it tests for and how it goes about doing so) in a file named
README.testing, <EM>which is to be turned in, along with your source
code and test files</EM>.

</P><H3>Storage Leaks</H3>

For this assignment, do not worry about storage leaks.
<SAMP>Purify</SAMP> may still be useful for detecting
illegal pointer references and array out-of-bounds errors.

<A name="turning in">
<H2>What To Turn In</H2>
</A>

To hand in your program, copy all of the files that are needed to
create and run the <SAMP>parse</SAMP> executable (including your
Makefile and your test program or programs) to
</P><PRE>  <SAMP>~cs536-1/public/Handin3/&lt;<I>your login name</I>&gt;</SAMP>
</PRE>
using your actual login name in place of &lt;<I>your login name</I>&gt;.
Please do <EM>not</EM> create any subdirectories in your handin directory,
and be sure <EM>not</EM> to copy any object files or executable files
(they take up a lot of space and may cause the directory to exceed its
quota).
<P>
After you have copied over your files, you can check that they
are there by issuing the command
</P><PRE>  <SAMP>ls -l ~cs536-1/public/Handin3/&lt;<I>your login name</I>&gt;</SAMP>
</PRE>
<P>
REMEMBER: <EM>No late assignments will be accepted without prior
permission!</EM>
Thus, it is important that you get to work soon.
</P><P>
As always, remember that partially finished programs are better than
no programs at all, so be sure to turn in whatever you&#39;ve done -- even
if you don&#39;t finish the assignment.
If you do turn in only a partially finished program, it is a good
idea to provide a description (say in a file called <SAMP>README</SAMP>)
of what works, what doesn&#39;t work, and sketch out how you would have gone
about changing things to finish up.
</P><P>
<EM>GOOD LUCK!!</EM>
