<h2>Introduction</h2>
</a>

For this assignment you will use <samp>flex</samp> to write a scanner
for a small language (a subset of C++), called Simple.
Features of <samp>Simple</samp> that are relevant to this assignment
are described below.
You will also write a main program to test your scanner.
You will be graded both on the correctness of your scanner
and on how thoroughly your main program tests the scanner.
</p><p>
Your scanner will use definitions in the files
<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/scanner.h">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/scanner.h</a></samp>
and
<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/gram.tab.h">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/gram.tab.h</a></samp>.
(Later in the term, after we create the parser, <samp>gram.tab.h</samp> will be
generated from our specification of the parser by the parser generator
<samp>bison</samp>.)
We have also provided you with an incomplete <samp>flex</samp> specification
for Simple
(<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/simple.l">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/simple.l</a></samp>),
an incomplete main program
(<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/main.cc">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/main.cc</a></samp>), and 
a Makefile
(<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/Makefile">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/Makefile</a></samp>).
</p><p>

<!--
<p>
In addition to creating the scanner,
classes, this assignment will allow you to gain experience with
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/cs536.html#purecov"><code>purecov</code></a>.
(The department now has a sufficient number of <samp>purecov</samp> licenses,
and our evaluation of your testing strategy will be based, in part, on
the reports that <samp>purecov</samp> generates.)

<p>
(You might also wish to experiment with
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/cs536.html#purify"><code>purify</code></a>.)

<a name="simple language">
<h2>The Simple Language</h2>
</a>

This section defines the lexical level of the Simple language.
At this level, we have the following language issues:
</p><dl>
<dt> TOKENS
</dt><dd>
The tokens of the Simple language are defined as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Any of the following reserved words:
<pre>int   float  bool   String   void    true
false if     else   while    write   return
</pre>
</li><li>
Any identifier (the same as C++ identifiers: a sequence of one or more
letters and/or digits, and/or underscores,
starting with a letter or underscore, excluding reserved words).
</li><li>
Any integer literal (a sequence of one or more digits).
</li><li>
Any float literal (a sequence of zero or more digits followed by a . and one or
more digits).
</li><li>
Any string literal (a sequence of zero or more ``string'' characters
surrounded by double quotes; a ``string'' character is either an
escaped character --- a backslash followed by any character other than
a newline, including a double quote or another backslash --- or a
single character other than newline or double quote or backslash).
Examples of legal string literals:
<pre>""
"&amp;!#"
"use \n to denote a newline character"
"include a \" like this and a \\ like this"
</pre>
Examples of things that are <em>not</em> legal string literals:
<pre>"unterminated
"also unterminated \"
</pre>
</li><li>
Any of the following one- or two-character symbols:
<pre>{      }     (      )      ,      =      ;
+      -     *      /      !      &amp;&amp;     ||
==     !=    &lt;      &gt;      &lt;=     &gt;=
</pre>
</li></ul>
Token ``names'' (i.e., values to be returned by the scanner)
are defined in the file
<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/gram.tab.h">gram.tab.h</a></samp>.
For example, the name for the token to be returned when an identifier
is recognized is ID.

</dd><dt> COMMENTS
</dt><dd>
Comments in Simple are like C++ comments:
they start with // and continue until end-of-line
(or end-of-file, if that comes first).
Note that the scanner should recognize comments, but that COMMENT is not
a token.

</dd><dt> WHITESPACE
</dt><dd>
Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are whitespace.

</dd><dt> ILLEGAL CHARACTERS
</dt><dd>
Any character that is not whitespace and is not part of a token or
comment is illegal.

</dd><dt> LENGTH LIMITS
</dt><dd>
You may not assume any limits on the lengths of identifiers, string literals,
integer literals, float literals, comments, etc.
</dd></dl>

<p>

<a name="scanner actions">
<h2>What the Scanner Should Do</h2>
</a>

In addition to identifying and returning the next token, your
scanner should record information about the line and ``column'' on which
the token starts;
this information should be recorded in the global variable <samp>yylval</samp>
(see <samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/scanner.h">scanner.h</a></samp>
and <samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/gram.tab.h">gram.tab.h</a></samp>.
Line and column numbers should both start from 1 (not 0).
``Column'' numbers should be a count of the number of characters from the beginning
of the line (not actual columns).  In particular, a tab should be treated
like any other character (scanning a tab causes the column number
to be incremented by one).
(See the description of the <a href="#main">main program</a> for information
about how the line and column counts will be used.)
</p><p>
For identifiers, integer literals, float literals, and string literals, your scanner
should also record (in <samp>yylval</samp>) the actual values of the tokens.
Variable <samp>yylval</samp> is a struct:
the <samp>lineNum</samp> and <samp>colNum</samp> fields are
to be filled in for every token;
the <samp>intVal</samp>, <samp>floatVal</samp>, and <samp>strVal</samp> fields are only
to be filled in for appropriate tokens;
note that the type of the <samp>strVal</samp> field is
``pointer to string''
so to fill it in, you must allocate new memory each time (see
<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/simple.l">simple.l</a></samp>).
For string literals, the value stored in <samp>yylval.strVal</samp> should be
the entire lexeme, including the enclosing quotes, and any backslash used as
an ``escape'' character inside the string.
</p><p>
Here are some useful variables provided by <samp>flex</samp>
(you can use them in the actions you write in your flex specification):
</p><dl>
<dt> <samp>yytext</samp>
</dt><dd>
This variable is of type <samp>char *</samp>.
It contains the actual characters that matched the current pattern.
</dd><dt> <samp>yyleng</samp>
</dt><dd>
This variable is of type <samp>int</samp>.
It contains the number of characters that matched the current pattern.
</dd></dl>
<p>
To convert an integer literal to an <samp>int</samp>, include the header files
<samp>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</samp>,
<samp>&lt;limits.h&gt;</samp>, and
<samp>&lt;float.h&gt;</samp>,
and use code like the following:
</p><pre>  <samp>double d;
  int k;
  d = atof(yytext);  // convert lexeme to a double
  // insert code here to check for bad value -- see Errors and Warnings below
  k = int(d);  // convert double to int</samp>
</pre>
<p>
To convert a float literal to a <samp>float</samp>, use code like this:
</p><pre>  <samp>double d;
  float v;
  d = atof(yytext);  // convert lexeme to a double
  // insert code here to check for bad value -- see Errors and Warnings below
  v = float(d);  // convert double to float</samp>
</pre>
<p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]


<a name="errors">
<h2>Errors and Warnings</h2>
</a>

The scanner should handle the following errors in the indicated ways:
</p><dl>
<dt> Illegal characters:
</dt><dd>
Issue the error message
``ignoring illegal character'' and ignore the character.
</dd><dt> Bad string literals (newline or end-of-file before closing quote):
</dt><dd>
Issue the error message ``ignoring unterminated string literal''
and ignore the unterminated string literal.
</dd></dl>
Error messages should be of the form:
<pre>  &lt;<i>line</i>&gt;:&lt;<i>column</i>&gt; <samp>ERROR</samp> &lt;<i>message</i>&gt;
</pre>
where &lt;<i>line</i>&gt; and &lt;<i>column</i>&gt; are the line
and column numbers of the <em>beginning</em> of the bad input,
and &lt;<i>message</i>&gt; is exactly as specified above.
<p>
The scanner should give the warning message
``integer literal too large; using max value''
if the input contains an
integer literal that is larger than INT_MAX (2147483647), and should return
INT_MAX in the <samp>intVal</samp> field for that token.
</p><p>
The scanner should give the warning message
``float literal too large; using max value''
if the input contains a float literal that is larger than FLT_MAX, and should return
FLT_MAX in the <samp>floatVal</samp> field for that token.
Similarly, the scanner should give the warning message
``float literal too small; using min value''
if the input contains a non-zero float literal that is smaller
than FLT_MIN, and should return
FLT_MIN in the <samp>floatVal</samp> field for that token.
</p><p>
Warning messages should be of the form:
</p><pre>  &lt;<i>line</i>&gt;:&lt;<i>column</i>&gt; <samp>WARNING</samp> &lt;<i>message</i>&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Error and warning messages should be written to <samp>cerr</samp>.
You should handle the printing of these messages in special
functions that take the line and column numbers and the message
as parameters.
That way, errors discovered in any phase of the compiler can be handled by
the same function.
<b>Because logically these functions are not associated with any
particular phase of the compiler, the error- and warning-handler functions
should be put in their own "message" module.</b>
</p><p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]


<a name="main">
<h2>The Main Program</h2>
</a>

In addition to specifying a scanner, you should extend the main
program in
<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/main.cc">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/main.cc</a></samp>.
The main program expects one command-line argument: the name of the file
to be scanned.
That file is opened for reading;
then the program loops, calling the scanner (<samp>yylex</samp>) until the
value 0 is returned.
The tokens returned by the scanner should be printed, one per line,
preceded by the token's line and column numbers:
</p><pre>  &lt;<i>line</i>&gt;:&lt;<i>column</i>&gt; &lt;<i>token</i>&gt;
</pre>
where &lt;<i>token</i>&gt; means the token ``name'' as defined in
<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/gram.tab.h">gram.tab.h</a></samp>,
for example, <samp>INTEGER</samp>, <samp>BOOLEAN</samp>, <samp>ID</samp>,
<samp>INTLITERAL</samp>).
For <samp>ID</samp>, <samp>STRINGLITERAL</samp>, <samp>FLOATLITERAL</samp>,
and <samp>INTLITERAL</samp> tokens,
the main program should also print the value returned (on
the same line as the token, enclosed in parentheses):
<pre>  &lt;<i>line</i>&gt;:&lt;<i>column</i>&gt; &lt;<i>token</i>&gt; ( &lt;<i>value</i>&gt; )
</pre>
<p>
Note the the purpose of the main program is only to test the scanner.
The scanner itself should be self-contained (e.g., the main
program should not initialize any variables for the scanner).
</p><p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="makefile">
<h2>The Makefile</h2>
</a>

You must also write a <samp>Makefile</samp> that is all set up with targets for
both compiling your program, as well as testing it.
In particular, the <samp>Makefile</samp> must retain the same basic
structure as <samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/Makefile">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/Makefile</a></samp>:
it must contain the target <samp>test</samp>, which is to perform as follows:
</p><ul>
  <li>
  Typing <samp>make test</samp> should first create <samp>scanner</samp>,
  and then should run <samp>scanner</samp> as many times as necessary to test your code.
  (You may want to have separate runs to test different error conditions.)
</li></ul>
<p>

<a name="files">
<h2>Finding/Using the Files for the Assignment</h2>
</a>

The files for this assignment are in the directory
<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton</a></samp>.
You should make a subdirectory called PROG2 in your <em>private</em>
directory, and place in that directory the files that you will be
using and modifying.
To set things up initially, you should issue the following commands:
</p><pre><samp>cd ~/private
mkdir PROG2
cd PROG2
cp ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/Makefile .
cp ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/gram.tab.h .
cp ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/main.cc .
cp ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/test2 .
cp ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/scanner.h .
cp ~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/simple.l .
</samp></pre>
<p>
The files <samp>main.cc</samp> and <samp>simple.l</samp> can serve as
a starting point for your implementation of the assignment.
</p><p>
When you initially invoke <samp>make</samp>, you should see something like
the following on your screen:
</p><pre><samp>% make
g++ -g -Wall -c main.cc
flex simple.l
g++ -g -Wall -c lex.yy.c -o scanner.o
lex.yy.c:988: warning: 'void yyunput(int, char*)' defined but not used
g++ -g -Wall -o scanner main.o scanner.o -ll</samp>
</pre>
<p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="testing">
<h2>Testing</h2>
</a>

Part of your task will be to figure out a strategy for testing
your implementation.
As mentioned in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>,
part of your grade will be determined by the testing scheme
that you implement; i.e., how thoroughly your main program and the test
files that you turn in test your scanner.
</p><p>
You are to add commands that invoke your tests to your <samp>Makefile</samp>.
The <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs536-1/Programs/PROG2/CodeSkeleton/Makefile"><samp>Makefile</samp>
that we have provided you with</a> serves as an example of how to
do this.
It includes a target, named <samp>test</samp>, that invokes a couple of tests.
</p><p>
In addition, put a brief description of each of your tests (e.g., what
it tests for and how it goes about doing so) in a file named
README.testing, <em>which is to be turned in, along with your source
code and test files</em>.

<!--
<p>
Depending on how you choose to format the file <samp>simple.l</samp>,
<samp>purecov</samp> may report that some lines are not covered.
In particular, the line with the pattern will be reported as
``not covered'' (even though the action is reported as ``covered'')
if you format things as follows:
<pre>
<samp>pattern              {
                       action
                     }</samp>
</pre>
<p>
Note that <samp>flex</samp> generates an output file, called
<samp>lex.yy.c</samp>.    
You are not likely to be able to get
<samp>purecov</samp> to report that your tests give complete
coverage of <samp>lex.yy.c</samp>.)
-->
</p><p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="turning in">
<h2>What to Turn In</h2>
</a>

To hand in your program, copy all of the files that are needed to
create and run the <samp>scanner</samp> program, (including your
Makefile and any required files of test data) to
</p><pre>  <samp>~cs536-1/public/Handin2/&lt;<i>your login name</i>&gt;</samp>
</pre>
using your actual login name in place of &lt;<i>your login name</i>&gt;.
Please do <em>not</em> create any subdirectories in your handin directory,
and be sure <em>not</em> to copy any object files or executable files
(they take up a lot of space and may cause the directory to exceed its
quota).
<p>
After you have copied over your files, you can check that they
are there by issuing the command
</p><pre>  <samp>ls -l ~cs536-1/public/Handin2/&lt;<i>your login name</i>&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
REMEMBER: <em>No late assignments will be accepted without prior
permission!</em>
Thus, it is important that you get to work soon.
</p><p>
As always, remember that partially finished programs are better than
no programs at all, so be sure to turn in whatever you've done -- even
if you don't finish the assignment.
If you do turn in only a partially finished program, it is a good
idea to provide a description (say in a file called <samp>README</samp>)
of what works, what doesn't work, and sketch out how you would have gone
about changing things to finish up.
</p><p>
<em>GOOD LUCK!!</em>
