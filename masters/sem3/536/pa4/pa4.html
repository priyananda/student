<h2>Introduction</h2>
</a>

For this assignment you will write a two-pass static-semantic analyzer for
<samp>Simple</samp> programs represented as abstract-syntax trees.
<b>This assignment involves considerably more programming than the
previous assignments, so it is important that you get to work on it
soon</b>.
<p>
The first pass, <a href="#name analysis">name analysis</a>,
performs the following kinds of tasks:
<ol>
<li>
Builds symbol tables (one global table, plus one local table for
each function) containing appropriate symbol-table entries for
each declaration of an identifier.
(In the case of function declarations, this should include
information about the number and types of the parameters.)
<li>
Finds multiply declared identifiers and uses of undeclared identifiers.
<li>
Updates the <samp>IdNode</samp>s of the abstract-syntax tree
to include pointers (i.e., ref_ptrs) to the corresponding symbol-table entries.
</ol>
We will refer to this pass as the <em>name analyzer</em>.
<p>
The second pass is the <em><a href="#type checking">type checker</a></em>.
It will determine the type of every expression represented
in the abstract-syntax tree, and use this information to identify
type errors, as described below.
<p>
You will also write a main program that first parses the
program in the file named on the command line, then calls the name analyzer.
If there have been no errors so far, it will then call the type checker.
(Calling the name analyzer and the type checker means calling the
appropriate member function of the <samp>ASTnode</samp> that is the
root of the tree built by the parser.)
<p>
As usual, ten percent of your grade will be based on how well you
test your code (your name analyzer and your type checker).
Therefore, you must provide one or more <samp>Simple</samp> programs that
thoroughly tests your code, and you must set up your <samp>Makefile</samp>
so that ``<samp>make test</samp>''
creates the executable <samp>parse</samp>
and runs it on your test input.
<p>
So that the graders can count on there being some uniformity to the
projects handed in by different students, your Makefile must be
organized on the following model (which is able to create and run
tests on <samp>parse</samp>):
<pre>
  <samp># Define which executable to run
  PARSE = parse
  
  OFILES =  ... all object files ...
  
  parse: $(OFILES)
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o parse $(OFILES) -ll
  
  ###
  # run tests
  ###
  test: $(PARSE)
        @echo "Test 1: no data file -------------------------------------"
        -$(PARSE)
        @echo "Test 2: sample 'program' -----------------------------------"
        -$(PARSE) test2.simple &gt; test2.out 2&gt; test2.err</samp>
</pre>
(Use <samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/CodeSolution/Makefile">/p/course/cs536-reps/public/html/Programs/PROG3/CodeSolution/Makefile</a></samp>
as a starting point for your <samp>Makefile</samp>.)

<a name="name analysis">
<h2>Name Analysis</h2>
</a>

<a name="programNode">
<h3>Adding Class <samp>ProgramNode</samp></h3>
</a>

You may find it useful to add one new kind of node,
<samp>ProgramNode</samp>, to the <samp>ASTnode</samp> hierarchy (a
<samp>ProgramNode</samp> is a subclass of <samp>ASTnode</samp>, and
has no subclasses itself).
The root node of the AST built by the parser would be a
<samp>ProgramNode</samp> (and no other <samp>ProgramNode</samp>s
would appear elsewhere in the AST);
it would have a single child of type <samp>DeclListNode</samp>.
The reason for using <samp>ProgramNode</samp> as the AST root
(rather than <samp>DeclListNode</samp>) is that, because it
would only appear at the root of an AST,
the name-analyzer member function of <samp>ProgramNode</samp>
can do whatever initialization is needed.
<p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="name analysis implementation">
<h3>Implementing the Name-Analysis Pass</h3>
</a>

You must implement your name analyzer by writing appropriate member
functions for the different subclasses of <samp>ASTnode</samp>.
So that the grader will be able to locate easily the functions
that implement the name analyzer, <b>this code is to go
in a file named ``<samp>name-analyzer.cc</samp>''</b>.
<p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="undeclared identifiers">
<h3>Multiply Declared and Undeclared Identifiers</h3>
</a>

The name analyzer is responsible for finding all instances of
multiply declared identifiers (identifiers declared more than once in
the same scope).
Note that this includes function names that are defined more than once.
It also includes formal parameters (i.e., a function is not
allowed to have two or more formal parameters with the same name).
Also note that a function's formal parameters are considered to be in the
<em>same</em> scope as that function's local variables (i.e., a function
is not allowed to have a formal parameter and a local variable with the same
name).
<p>
An error message (see below) should be given for each multiply
declared identifier, and all but the first declaration should be
ignored (i.e., do not update the symbol table when you are
processing an identifier that is multiply declared, and do not bother to link
that IdNode to any symbol-table entry).
<p>
The name analyzer is also responsible for finding all instances of
uses of undeclared identifiers.
Note that this includes calls to functions that have not yet been declared.
An error message should be given for each use of an undeclared identifier.
<p>
In addition, the name analyzer is responsible for checking that the program
includes a function named <samp>main</samp>.
If the program does not, the error message ``<samp>No main function declared</samp>''
is to be issued (using zero for both the line and column numbers).
<p>
Error messages should have the same format as in the scanner and parser
(i.e., they should include a line and column number indicating the
position of the error).
For multiply declared or undeclared identifiers, the reported position
should be the first character of the identifier.
<p>
In summary, your name analyzer should find all of the errors described
in the following table;
it must report the specified position of the error,
and it must give <em>exactly</em> the specified error message.
(Each message should appear on a single line, rather than how it is
formatted in the following table.)

<a name="class idnode">
<h3>Extending Class <samp>IdNode</samp></h3>
</a>

You should add a field of type ``<samp>ref_ptr&lt;Symbol&gt;</samp>'' to the
<samp>IdNode</samp> class.
For every <samp>IdNode</samp> that corresponds to a valid declaration
or a valid use of an identifier, your name analyzer should fill
in this field with a ref_ptr to the corresponding symbol-table entry.
<p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="class symbol">
<h3>Extending Class<samp>Symbol</samp></h3>
</a>

A symbol-table entry will need to contain the type of each symbol as
well as its name.
For function names, the symbol-table entry will also need to
include information about the number of parameters and their types
(this could be accomplished by having a list of the symbol-table entries
for the parameters).
All of this information will be needed in order to implement the
<a href="#type checking">type checker</a>.
<p>
Eventually, you will also need to know the number
of local variables declared in each function, and the offsets
for each parameter and each local variable
(i.e., where they will be stored in the function's activation
record).
You can handle computing and recording this information now, or you can add
code to do this when you do Programming Assignment 5.
<p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="error handling">
<h2>Changes to the Error-Handling Function</h2>
</a>

Your compiler should quit after the name-analysis pass if any
errors have been detected so far (either by the scanner, the parser, or
the name analyzer).
To accomplish this, you can use a global variable (of type <samp>bool</samp>)
that is declared and initialized to <samp>false</samp>
in your <samp>main</samp> program, and is set
to <samp>true</samp> by your error-handling function (the function that handles
warnings should not change the value of this variable).
Alternatively, the global variable can be of type <samp>int</samp>,
initialized to <samp>0</samp>, and incremented by the error-handling
function.
The <samp>main</samp> program can check the value of this variable,
and only call the type-checker if it is <samp>false</samp> or
<samp>0</samp>.
<p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="type checking">
<h2>Type Checking</h2>
</a>

You must implement your type checker by writing appropriate member
functions for the different subclasses of <samp>ASTnode</samp>.
So that the grader will be able to locate easily the functions
that implement the type checker, <b>this code is to go
in a file named ``<samp>type-checker.cc</samp>''</b>.
<p>
Your type checker should find all of the type errors described in the
following table;
it must report the specified position of the error,
and it must give <em>exactly</em> the specified error message.
(Each message should appear on a single line, rather than how it is
formatted in the following table.)

<p>
To perform type-checking, you should introduce the enumerated type:
<pre>
   <samp>enum SymbolType {IntType, FloatType, BoolType, StringType, FnType, ErrorType};</samp>
</pre>
<samp>ErrorType</samp> is used to prevent a single type error
in an expression or statement from triggering multiple error messages,
For example, each of the following expressions should cause only one error
message:
<pre>
  <samp>(true + 3) * 4
  true && (false || 3)</samp>
</pre>
The type given to <samp>(true + 3)</samp> should be <samp>ErrorType</samp>,
and the instance of the multiplication operator should <em>not</em> report
``Arithmetic operator applied to non-numeric operand'' for the
first operand.
But note that the following should cause <em>two</em> error messages (one for
each of the non-integer operands of the plus operator):
<pre>
  <samp>true + "hello"</samp>
</pre>
<p>
To provide some help with this issue, 
<a href="example.simple">here is an example input file</a>, along
with the <a href="example.err">corresponding file of error messsages</a>.
(Note: This is not meant to a complete test of the type checker;
it is provided merely to help you understand some of the messages you
need to report.)
<p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="advice">
<h2>Some Advice</h2>
</a>

Here are few words of advice about various issues that come up
in the assignment:
<ul>
<li>
The tree-traversal code you wrote to perform unparsing provides
a good model for the traversals that you need to write to handle
<a href="#name analysis">name analysis</a> and
<a href="#type checking">type checking</a>.
(See <samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/CodeSolution/unparse.cc">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG3/CodeSolution/unparse.cc</a></samp> and
<samp><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/Programs/PROG3/CodeSolution/ast.h">~cs536-1/public/html/Programs/PROG3/CodeSolution/ast.h</a></samp>.)
However, you probably do <em>not</em> want to declare the name-analysis
and type-checking member functions to be virtual members of class
<samp>ASTnode</samp> (as we did for <samp>Unparse</samp>).
The reason is that this will require you to supply a member
function for <em>all</em> subclasses of <samp>ASTnode</samp>.
This was OK for <samp>Unparse</samp>, because we wanted to have a
pretty-printing function for each node in the tree; however, for type
checking (for example), the type-checking traversal does not need to
visit all parts of the tree, so not all node classes need furnish a
type-checking member function.
<p>
However, you may find it useful to declare the name-analysis and
type-checking functions to be virtual members of classes that are lower
down in the inheritance hierarchy.
<p>
<li>
Note that <samp>Symbol</samp>s need to persist beyond the lifetime of the
<samp>SymbolTable</samp>s they are in because we are having
the name analyzer create a ref_ptr link between
every <samp>IdNode</samp> (that corresponds to a valid declaration
or a valid use of an identifier) and the corresponding symbol-table entry.
Because of the automatic reference counting provided by
ref_ptrs, this should happen automatically:
the occurrences of <samp>Symbol</samp> will persist beyond the lifetime
of the <samp>SymbolTable</samp>s they are in.
<p>
<li>
  I found it useful to change <samp>Unparse</samp> so that it produced
  an annotated version of the code in which all identifiers (both in
  declarations and in statements) are annotated with their types.  For
  instance, for the <a href="example.simple">example input file</a>
  referred to earlier, here is the <a href="example.out">corresponding
  output file</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Finding/Using the Files for the Assignment</h2>

<p>
You should make a subdirectory called <samp>PROG4</samp>
in your <samp>private</samp> directory, and work on things for
this programming assignment in that subdirectory.
<p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="testing">
<h2>Testing</h2>
</a>

Part of your task will be to figure out a strategy for testing
your implementation.
As mentioned in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>,
part of your grade will be determined by the testing scheme
that you implement; i.e., how thoroughly your main program and the test
files that you turn in test your parser.
<p>
As usual, put a brief description of each of your tests (e.g., what
it tests for and how it goes about doing so) in a file named
README.testing, <em>which is to be turned in, along with your source
code and test files</em>.
<p>
[<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>]

<a name="turning in">
<h2>What To Turn In</h2>
</a>

To hand in your program, copy all of the files that are needed to
create and run <samp>parse</samp>, including
your Makefile, your test program(s), and README.testing to
<pre>
  <samp>~cs536-1/public/Handin4/&lt;<i>your login name</i>&gt;</samp>
</pre>
using your actual login name in place of &lt;<i>your login name</i>&gt;.
Please do <em>not</em> create any subdirectories in your handin directory,
and be sure <em>not</em> to copy any object files or executable files
(they take up a lot of space and may cause the directory to exceed its
quota).
<p>
After you have copied over your files, you can check that they
are there by issuing the command
<pre>
  <samp>ls -l ~cs536-1/public/Handin4/&lt;<i>your login name</i>&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
REMEMBER: <em>No late assignments will be accepted without prior
permission!</em>
Thus, it is important that you get to work soon.
<p>
As always, remember that partially finished programs are better than
no programs at all, so be sure to turn in whatever you've done --- even
if you don't finish the assignment.
If you do turn in only a partially finished program, it is a good
idea to provide a description (say in a file called <samp>README</samp>)
of what works, what doesn't work, and sketch out how you would have gone
about changing things to finish up.
<p>
<em>GOOD LUCK!!</em>
