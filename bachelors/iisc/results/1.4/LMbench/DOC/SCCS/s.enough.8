.SH NAME
enough \- report timing interval duration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B enough
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B enough
reports the timing interval duration
.BR ENOUGH .
The required timing interval is determined experimentally to
ensure that the timing results are accurate to within 1% in
the spite of the system clock resolution and measurement 
overheads.  
It is necessary to measure
.B ENOUGH
experimentally because system clock resolution varies widely
across systems, from as large as 10 milliseconds to as small
as 1 microsecond, a range of four orders of magnitude.
.SH OUTPUT
The output is reported in microseconds as an integer:
