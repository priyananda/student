.SH NAME
lat_unix \- measure interprocess communication latency through Unix sockets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lat_unix
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lat_unix
uses two processes communicating through a Unix socket to measure interprocess
communication latencies.  The benchmark passes a token back and forth between
the two processes (this sort of benchmark is frequently referred to as a
``hot potato'' benchmark).  No other work is done in the processes.
.SH OUTPUT
The reported time is in microseconds per round trip and includes the total
time, i.e., the context switching overhead is included.
Output format is like so
.sp
.ft CB
AF_UNIX sock stream latency: 491 microseconds

.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Funding for the development of
this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems Computer Corporation.
