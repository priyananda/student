.TH LAT_HTTP 8 "$Date$" "(c)1994 Larry McVoy" "LMBENCH"
.SH NAME
lat_http \- measure HTTP latencies
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lat_http
.I -s
.sp .5
.B lat_tcp
.I hostname
.sp .5
.B lat_tcp
.I -hostname
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lat_http
implements a
.I very
simple HTTP server and uses this simple server to measure
HTTP version 1.0 transactional latency.  
.PP
.B lat_http
has three forms of usage: as a server (lat_http -s), 
as a client (lat_http localhost), and
as a shutdown (lat_http -localhost).
.PP
.B lat_http
is not meant to be used to measure HTTP server performance,
but was intended to provide some insight into the potential
performance for HTTP version 1.0 servers.  
HTTP version 1.0 is very inefficient with respect to system
and networking resources, since it creates a new TCP connection
for each file request.
.SH OUTPUT
.B lat_http
reports the average file size, the total number of bytes
transferred, the total time to transfer the data, and
the average bandwidth, i.e.:
.sp
.ft CB
Avg xfer: 3.2KB, 41.8KB in 14.4990 millisecs, 2.88 MB/sec
.ft
