.SH NAME
lat_tcp \- measure interprocess communication latency via TCP/IP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lat_tcp
.I -s
.sp .5
.B lat_tcp
.I hostname
.sp .5
.B lat_tcp
.I -hostname
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lat_tcp
is a client/server program that measures interprocess
communication latencies.  The benchmark passes a token back and forth between
the two processes (this sort of benchmark is frequently referred to as a
``hot potato'' benchmark).  No other work is done in the processes.

I 3
has three forms of usage: as a server (lat_tcp -s), 
as a client (lat_tcp localhost), and
E 3
as a shutdown (lat_tcp -localhost).
.SH OUTPUT
The reported time is in microseconds per round trip and includes the total

I 3
time, i.e., the context switching overhead is included.
