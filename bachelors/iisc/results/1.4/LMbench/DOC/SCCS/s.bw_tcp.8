.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bw_tcp
is a client/server program that moves data over a TCP/IP socket.  Nothing is
D 3
done with the data on either side; the data is moved in 48KB chunks.

done with the data on either side; the data is moved in 64KB chunks.

.B bw_tcp
has three forms of usage: as a server (-s), as a client (bw_tcp localhost), and
as a shutdown (bw_tcp -localhost).

The default amount of data is 3MB.  The client form may specify a different
amount of data.  Specifications may end with ``k'' or ``m'' to mean
kilobytes (* 1024) or megabytes (* 1024 * 1024).

.SH MEMORY UTILIZATION
D 3
This benchmark can move up to six times the requested memory per process.
E 3
I 3
This benchmark can move up to six times the requested memory per process
when run through the loopback device.
E 3
There are two processes, the sender and the receiver.
Most Unix
systems implement the read/write system calls as a bcopy from/to kernel space
to/from user space.  Bcopy will use 2-3 times as much memory bandwidth:
there is one read from the source and a write to the destionation.  The
write usually results in a cache line read and then a write back of
the cache line at some later point.  Memory utilization might be reduced
by 1/3 if the processor architecture implemented "load cache line"
and "store cache line" instructions (as well as getcachelinesize).
