.SH NAME
lat_pipe \- measure interprocess communication latency through pipes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lat_pipe
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lat_pipe
uses two processes communicating through a Unix pipe to measure interprocess
communication latencies.  The benchmark passes a token back and forth between
the two processes (this sort of benchmark is frequently referred to as a
``hot potato'' benchmark).  No other work is done in the processes.
.SH OUTPUT
The reported time is in microseconds per round trip and includes the total
D 3
time, i.e., the context switching overhead is includeded.
E 3
I 3
time, i.e., the context switching overhead is included.
E 3
Output format is like so
.sp
.ft CB
Pipe latency: 491 microseconds
