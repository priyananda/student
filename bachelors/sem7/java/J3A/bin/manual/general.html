<p> The Fall of Numenor is a fantsay-cum-role-playing-cum-action-strategy game. The gameplay is simple,reach the
last tile.In between kill all the monsters, get all the spells and have a rollicking time!!!. Remember monsters are
your enemies and spells your friends. To kill a monster,use a spell. Each monster or spell has its own wierd properties
. Use the knowledge to your advantage.
<p> Frequently obtain health or you will face the ultimate humiliation - death.Oh yes,you can use cheats, but you
know what that makes you,don't you ?
